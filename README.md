# Big_Data
ProblemSet 1
Part 1 and Part 2 would give you an insight on using pandas.
Part 3 will focus on cleaning the dataset for missing datapoints.
Part 4 and Exercise 5 would involve generating graphs based on the traffic dataset.

ProblemSet2 
Load the Iris Dataset
Implement Standard Scalar based feature extraction
Implement PCA and use all components and compute the explained variance of each PCA component
Implement PCA and use two components that explain maximum variance. Implement logistic regression model to train and test and give a visual display of the performance by showing a plot of the decision regions along with the test data. Print the test accuracy.

ProblemSet3
In this Project, we will work with CIFAR10 image dataset. Test the project on Google Colab running on a CPU, GPU and TPU

ProblemSet4
This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. This guide uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.
