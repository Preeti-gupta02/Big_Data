# Big_Data
ProblemSet 1
Part 1 and Part 2 would give you an insight on using pandas.
Part 3 will focus on cleaning the dataset for missing datapoints.
Part 4 and Exercise 5 would involve generating graphs based on the traffic dataset.

ProblemSet2 
Load the Iris Dataset
Implement Standard Scalar based feature extraction
Implement PCA and use all components and compute the explained variance of each PCA component
Implement PCA and use two components that explain maximum variance. Implement logistic regression model to train and test and give a visual display of the performance by showing a plot of the decision regions along with the test data. Print the test accuracy.
